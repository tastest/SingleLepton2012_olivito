#### Using this code:

# Check out this directory into SingleLepton2012/macros:
cvs co -d WHLooper UserCode/olivito/SingleLepton2012/macros/WHLooper

# Make sure you have the latest versions of macros/Core, macros/Plotting, and Tools/BTagReshaping

# compile
make

# To run, the script doAll.C has most of the options, including input directory and which babies are picked up for each background.  
# The script do.sh lauches jobs in parallel to run each background.  
# The output appears in WHLooper/output/OUTDIR, where OUTDIR is specified in do.sh.
# Once things are set up, to run, just do:
mkdir output
. do.sh

# Running takes a while (~40min for the longest sample, ttbar1l), because I make a ton of histograms.  
# To speed up a little bit, regions can be turned on and off in WHLooper near the top with the "doCRX" flags.
# There are a lot of regions defined, basically anything I've ever looked at... The main important ones are:
const bool doSignalMassLast = true;
const bool doSignalMETLast = true;
const bool doCR23 = true; // dilep + (lep+track)
const bool doCR5METLast = true; // bveto
const bool doCR14 = true; // inverted mbb region
